# Taxi-Company
A taxi company managment program written in C++.
This is a simple console program that showcases the basic principles of C++ and object-oriented programming including: constants, constructors & destructors, operators, inheritance, STL and more.<br>
The project divided into 3 parts: (3 branches)<br>
**Part 1** - Come up with a project idea and write out only its header files, and hand them out the other couples in the class. We wrote headers for an Airport Manager program.<br>
**Part 2** - Take another couple's header files and project, and encode its .cpp files without using any STL or templates.<br>
**Part 3** - Implement a Linked List data structure as a Template, Change all the arrays within part2 code to either strings, lists or linked lists. In addition, introduce various design patterns into the code.<br>
This project contributed to our skill to perform code analysis and critical thinking, exposing us to a real-world scenario as well as concluding the knowledge of C++ we acquired throught the course. <br>

### Key Features:
-Relevant use of Constants
-Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance and Diamond Inheritance<br>
-Distinguishing between the use of references, pointers, and arrays of pointers<br>
-Implementation of the LinkedList data structure.<br>
-Using LinkedList as a Template.<br>
-Utilization of STL including string, and list.<br>
-Design Patterns including Singleton, Facade and Factory.<br>
