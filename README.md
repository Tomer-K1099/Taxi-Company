# Taxi-Company
A taxi company managment program written in C++.
This is a simple console program that showcases the basic principles of C++ and object-oriented programming including: constants, constructors & destructors, operators, inheritance, STL and more.
Every couple was instructed to come up with a project idea, write out only its header files and hand them out to the class. Later, every group chose the project of another couple, analyze its headers, make necessary changes and encode their .cpp files, so we chose the Taxi Company project. This instruction contributed to our skill to perform code analysis, collaboration and problem solving, as well as exposing us to a real-world scenario. <br>

### Key Features:
-Relevant use of Constants
-Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance and Diamond Inheritance<br>
-Distinguishing between the use of references, pointers, and arrays of pointers<br>
-Implementation of the LinkedList data structure.<br>
-Using LinkedList as a Template.<br>
-Utilization of STL including string, and list.<br>
-Design Patterns including Singleton, Facade and Factory.<br>
